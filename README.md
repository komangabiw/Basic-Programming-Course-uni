# Learning Basic Programming with Java

This repository contains a collection of Java programs I developed while learning basic programming concepts at my university. These projects demonstrate fundamental skills in problem-solving, algorithm implementation, and Java programming syntax.

## About My Learning Journey

During my studies, I focused on understanding key programming principles, including:

- **Input/Output Handling:** Reading data from users and displaying results effectively.
- **Control Structures:** Using loops, conditionals, and switches to guide program logic.
- **Data Structures:** Implementing arrays for storing and manipulating collections of data.
- **String Manipulation:** Extracting, modifying, and processing text-based data.
- **Functions and Methods:** Writing reusable and modular code.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a reflection of my progress and a foundation for advancing to more complex programming topics. I hope it inspires others to explore the exciting world of coding!
